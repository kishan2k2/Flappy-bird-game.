Velocity of X coordinate and Y coordinates are set.
Flapped variable is set to false.
Check if the player want to quit the game.
If not set playerFlapped to true.
Do the crash test using the x and y coordinate of bird, and the coordinate of lower and upper pipe.
The score is incremented using the mid position of pipe if it 4 px right to the pipe then the score is incremented.
If the player hasnâ€™t flapped and Y vel is less than maxvel then increment the Y velocity.
Increase the vel/position of pipes lower and upper.
Introduce a new pipe when the pipe is near to 0- 5 px to the screen.
If the pipe has crossed the screen we pop upper and lower pipe.
